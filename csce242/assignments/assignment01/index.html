        <h1> Solar System</h1>
        <img src="images/space.jpg" alt="space">
        <p> The Solar System is a fascinating and intricate structure in space. 
            It consists of the Sun at the center, surrounded by eight planets, 
            moons, comets, asteroids, and other celestial objects. 
            Each planet has unique features that distinguish it, 
            ranging from the rocky surface of Mercury to the gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
        <p>
            Humans have always been curious about the Solar System, 
            leading to the development of advanced telescopes and space exploration missions. 
            NASA's missions, such as the Mars rovers, have helped uncover 
            a wealth of information about our neighboring planets. 
            Learning about the Solar System allows us to better understand 
            Earth's place in the vast universe.</p>
